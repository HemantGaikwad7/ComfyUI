## Integrating Hugging Face with ComfiUI

1. **Install the Hugging Face Transformers Library**:
   - In the ComfiUI directory, open a terminal and run:
     ```bash
     .\python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install transformers
     ```

2. **Authenticate Hugging Face**:
   - Create an API token from your Hugging Face account ([link](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)).
   - Use this token to log in via terminal:
     ```bash
     .\python_embeded\python.exe -m transformers-cli login
     ```

3. **Download Models from Hugging Face**:
   - Search for Stable Diffusion models on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models).
   - Download the model weights and place them in the `models\checkpoints` directory within ComfiUI.

4. **Load the Model in ComfiUI**:
   - Launch ComfiUI and verify the model appears in the "Models" section.
